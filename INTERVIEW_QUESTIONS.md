## Interview Questions on Data Preprocessing

1. **What are the different types of missing data?**  
   - Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)  
   - Missing at Random (MAR)  
   - Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

2. **How do you handle categorical variables?**  
   - Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Target Encoding

3. **What is the difference between normalization and standardization?**  
   - Normalization: Scales values to [0,1]  
   - Standardization: Scales values to have mean 0 and std 1

4. **How do you detect outliers?**  
   - Boxplots, Z-score, IQR method, Visualization

5. **Why is preprocessing important in ML?**  
   - Improves model accuracy, reduces bias, handles missing values, scales features

6. **What is one-hot encoding vs label encoding?**  
   - Label Encoding: Converts categories to numeric labels  
   - One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category

7. **How do you handle data imbalance?**  
   - Oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, class weighting

8. **Can preprocessing affect model accuracy?**  
   -  Yes. Proper preprocessing ensures features are in a suitable format, improves convergence, reduces bias, and can significantly boost accuracy.
